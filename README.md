# Better Tab Minecraft Data Pack

### Better Tab is a data pack that adds several chips to a player's nickname on the server tab.

## How to use Better Tab
After you install this data pack on your server and enter the `/reload` command, nothing will happen except for the Reload Done chat notification.
To enable any of the features, you need to write the command `/function mine:options/<name_functional>`. Note that every function that starts with `/function mine:options/` must end with `/on` or `/off`, except for the `off_all` and `on_all` functions, for example `/function mine:options/afk/on`.

**YOU NEED TO ENTER ONE OF THESE COMMANDS, OTHERWISE THE DATA PACKAGE WILL NOT WORK.** If you are not using resource packs specific to this data pack, you need to use this command `/function mine:config/rp_disable`. If you are using any resource pack that changes these icons, you need to use this command `/function mine:config/rp_enable`.
